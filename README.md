# Getting Started with this Repo
Hi. This is Rebecca's interactive resume. She has deployed it to: https://rckrieger.github.io/resume/ 
Most of the work for it was done in this repo- https://github.com/rckrieger/Rebecca-Live-Resume, but after she deleted the gh-pages branch to try to change the URL, it would not rebuild without errors. Reverting was failing too, so she took her last working commit and copied the files into a new repo
